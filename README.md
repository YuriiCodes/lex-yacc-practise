# Arithmetic Parser 🧮

## Description 📝
This project is an arithmetic parser developed using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). It is capable of parsing and computing both simple and complex arithmetic expressions, providing a powerful tool for mathematical computations.

## Features 🌟
- **Support for Basic Operations**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Advanced Operations**: Exponentiation (`^`), modulus (`mod`), square root (`sqrt()`).
- **Variable Support**: Ability to use variables for storing intermediate results.
- **Flexible Grammar**: Uses context-free grammar for parsing expressions.
- **Interactive Mode**: Input and compute expressions in real-time.

## Installation 🔧
To install and run the parser:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run `main.py` for interactive mode.

## How to Use 🚀
Simply run `main.py` and enter an arithmetic expression. Examples:
- `2 + 3 * 4`
- `x = 5`
- `y = (x + 15)^4`

## Tests 🧪
To run the tests, run `unit_tests.py`. This will run the test suite and output the results.
